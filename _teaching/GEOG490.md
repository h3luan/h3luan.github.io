Course Description
=====
This course introduces the applications of GIS and spatial statistics in exploring and analyzing spatial health and medical datasets. Three major themes will be explored: 1) spatial and spatiotemporal patterns of health phenomena, 2) risk factors associated with health outcomes, and 3) health service access. The course focuses on preparing and organizing health datasets, detecting disease clusters, statistically modeling the association between risk factors and health outcomes, interpolating point- and area-based health data, and measuring and optimizing health services. Weekly assignments will provide hands on experience with example health data. Students who successfully complete this course will develop a skill set of spatial analytical methods to solve contemporary health and medical geographical problems.

This course introduces the theory, methods, and tools used to conduct spatial analysis and understand geographical phenomena. Topics covered in this course include descriptive spatial analysis, probability theory, spatial sampling, inferential spatial analysis, spatial interpolation, spatial correlation, and spatial regression. Common issues in spatial analysis will also be introduced, such as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and the Uncertain Geographic Context Problem (UGCoP). Lectures focus on the geographic theory and associated (mathematical) equations behind each method, and assignments provide an opportunity for students to implement a variety of methods to address questions that are geographic in nature.

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Oregon](https://geography.uoregon.edu), [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/). My program of research focuses on advancing probabilistic inferences in geospatial data analysis. I use spatiotemporal statsitics, implemented with the Bayesian paradigm, to explore inequities of urban environmental exposures and their associations with health. My work uses both Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to implement Bayesian spatial and spatiotemporal models. In addition, I apply machine learning to analyze geospatial mobile health data collected from AppleWatch and Fitbit.

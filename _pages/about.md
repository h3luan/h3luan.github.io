I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Oregon](https://geography.uoregon.edu), [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/). My program of research focuses on advancing probabilistic inferences in geospatial data analysis. I use spatiotemporal statsitics, implemented with the Bayesian paradigm, to explore inequities of urban environmental exposures and their associations with health. I also apply (Bayesian) machine learning and computational methods including Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to efficiently analyze large volumes of heterogeneous geographical data.

I am an Assistant Professor of Spatial Epidemiology in the [Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health](https://osph.utsouthwestern.edu/) at [UT Southwestern Medical Center](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/). My _**research program**_ investigates two major questions: 1) how do health phenomena vary over space, time, and race/ethnicity? 2) what environmental factors (social, physical, and built) contribute to these spatial, temporal, and racial/ethnic variations? My work focuses on modifiable factors including pre-exposure prophylaxis providers (PrEP) and food outlets. To answer these questions, I use Bayesian spatial and spatiotemporal statistical models and Geographical Information Science techniques. My research aims to advance Bayesian probabilistic inferences in spatial health data analysis, promote the application of spatial and spatiotemporal analysis in public health, inform the development of geographically tailored, evidence-based health intervention programs, and ultimately improve population health.
